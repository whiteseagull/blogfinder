## A tool to find people on blogs
When reading a blog, you find comments and also, on WordPress.com, likes, i.e. someone is telling she/he likes the post.

Usually you see one post at a time, but maybe you are interested in seeing all  the users that commented or put a like. 
Blog Finder solves this problem: it scans all the posts in the time period specified and shows a list of users that commented or liked a post. 

## Blog Finder finds other blogs too
Blog Finder lets you find other blogs too because when listing the users that commented a blog, it shows also the user URL which is usually the user's site or blog, and ofter the user's blog for users that leave comments on blog sites like WordPress.com

## How Blog Finder works
Blog Finder uses the **WordPress REST API** and the **WordPress.com  REST API** to fetch data about blogs, comments and likes (they are quite similar, but not equal)
